		Buildings consume 40% of the energy in the US annually, and they emit nearly half of the carbon dioxide through cement production and the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. Since CO2 captures solar energy in the atmosphere it results in the heating of the planet. This is why making buildings (and hence the architecture profession) is largely in part responsible for a lot of CO2 in our atmosphere, and thereby responsible to create more environments that produce little to no CO2. <br><br>

		As temperatures rise, construction will be hit hard, since so much of it occurs in open air. Any day hotter than 90 F cuts outdoor daily labor supply by up to 14%, as workers will not be able to simply show up due to fatigue and illness. Job productivity would drop too. <br><br>

		Even if the world stopped releasing CO2 completely this instant, the climate would still continue to change because the greenhouse gases already present in our atmosphere would take millenia to dissipate; but that doesn't mean there isn't work to do. <br><br>

		<b>So what can be done?</b><br><br>

		<ol>
			<li><b>Pursue Renewable Energy</b></li>
				<p>It is now possible for buildings to produce and store more clean energy (from renewable sources such as solar and geothermal) than they use! If net-zero energy isn't possible, a carbon-neutral approach can still be taken through the purchase of offsets (payments to protect forests, increase renewable energy practices and fund other sustainable practices to reduce emissions). <br><br>

		    	If 9.7% of new buildings are net-zero energy by 2050, emissions will be 7.1 gigatons lower. However, energy-efficiency is just one of the climate-change related issues architects are tasked with solving. There are others, including construction waste, land use and fresh water consumption.<br><br></p>
		    <li><b>Select carbon-smart materials</b></li>	
		    	<p>Manufacturing steel and concrete and using aluminium and foam insulation result in a huge carbon footprint. Architects must minimize the use of energy and carbon intensive technologies such as electric lighting and air-conditioning, and start using low-tech solutions like passive ventilation. Structural timber is a viable alternative to concrete frames, however, an increase in the use of timber must come in parallel with sustainable forestry management. As an architect, you can use your influence as product specifiers to move manfacturers towards solutions that emit far less CO2 and consume far less resources. <br><br>

		    <li><b>Adapt and retrofit existing buildings</b></li>	
		    	<p>This not only helps to reduce emmissions, but also  helps bolster buildings' infrastructure so they will be able to endure what's to come. <br><br>

			    </p>
			<li><b>Reuse building materials</b></li>   
				<p>Every year the construction industry sends hundreds of millions of tons of non-industrial waste to landfills, much of which arrives from demolition taken down before the beginning of new construction projects. Reusing discarded raw materials not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions (from manufacturing new raw materials) but also cuts down on costs.<br><br></p>
			<li><b>Be more well versed with digital technology</b></li>
				<p>Certain digital technology offers the ability to estimate a project's impact in advance.  This can also help guide decisions that influence a project's environmental footprint and can help it be completed quicker with less last minute on-site changes - this reduces waste and overall energy consumption.<br><br>
